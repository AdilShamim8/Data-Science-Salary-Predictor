# Exploratory Data Analysis on Data Science Salaries

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on data science salaries across different regions, experience levels, company sizes, and job roles. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help professionals, hiring managers, and aspiring data scientists understand the current state of compensation in the data science field.

## Dataset
The analysis is performed on a dataset containing salary information for various data science roles, including:
- Job titles (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, ML Engineer, etc.)
- Experience levels (Entry-level, Mid-level, Senior, Executive)
- Employment types (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Freelance)
- Company locations and sizes
- Remote work ratios
- Salary information in different currencies and USD conversion

## Key Questions Explored
- How do data science salaries vary across different regions?
- What is the impact of experience level on compensation?
- Is there a significant difference in salaries between remote and on-site roles?
- How have data science salaries evolved over recent years?
- Which data science specializations command the highest salaries?
- How does company size influence compensation packages?

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language used
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment

## Key Findings

## Visualizations
The repository includes several visualizations to help understand salary distributions:
- Distribution plots of salaries across job titles
- Heatmaps showing correlation between variables
- Geographic visualizations of salary differences by location
- Time series analysis of salary trends
- Comparative analysis between different job roles and experience levels
